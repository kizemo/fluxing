# Lessons Learned — Fluxing (rime/weasel fork)

> **Scope**: `Fluxing` project (`rime/weasel` fork), reusable lessons distilled from dev incidents. Each entry: **Incident → Root cause → Lesson** format, source-recorded.
> **Origin of this file**: commit `d6e2e1e` "docs(memory): lessons-learned - 沉淀开发事故教训" (initial L01–L07).

> **2026-06-30 encoding recovery notice (this version)**
>
> The original file accumulated a triple-encoding damage chain across L01–L10:
> PowerShell 5.1 + `chcp 936` (GBK) read UTF-8 Chinese as GBK bytes → re-encode as
> UTF-16 LE (via `Out-File` / `Set-Content` with default encoding) → corrupt on
> next checkout. The HEAD blob is UTF-16 LE with BOM (42,068 bytes) containing
> GBK-mojibake Chinese that is **not recoverable** byte-wise. This version is a
> full English rewrite. English is the chosen replacement because:
> 1. L08, L09, L10 commit messages already contain the full English lesson
>    summary; L01–L07 topics are recoverable from headings and this session's
>    history.
> 2. Markdown rendering on GitHub, VS Code, and the Codex CLI loader is
>    consistent for English; UTF-8-no-BOM is the only safe encoding.
> 3. The technical content (file paths, hex bytes, command names, error codes)
>    was always English; only the prose was Chinese. The English rewrite loses
>    no technical specificity.

## L01 - Chinese UTF-8 file read/write — PowerShell 5.1 + GBK codepage trap

**Incident**: Commit `c0951ca` shipped 8 spec files whose body was supposedly
"Chinese UTF-8" but was actually the result of "GBK bytes being decoded as
Unicode then re-encoded as UTF-8" — a hybrid mess. `git hash-object` confirmed
the working-tree hash matched the commit (because the working file *was* the
committed bytes), but the Chinese content was already corrupt.

**Root cause** (PowerShell 5.1 + `chcp 936`):

1. `Get-Content -Raw path` reads a UTF-8 file but **decodes the UTF-8 bytes
   using the current codepage (936 = GBK)** → returns a "GBK-decoded Unicode"
   string (i.e., Unicode code points matching what a GBK double-byte decoder
   would have produced from the same bytes).
2. Any PS string-layer operation (`$s.Substring(...)`, `-replace`, `+`, etc.)
   works on the **wrong** code points.
3. `[IO.File]::WriteAllText(path, $s, [UTF8Encoding]$false)` writes those wrong
   code points as UTF-8 → each GBK byte (0x00-0xFF) becomes 1 Unicode code
   point → encoded back to UTF-8 as 2 bytes (or 3 for high values).
4. `Get-Content` reads it back the same way → looks "self-consistent" → the
   corruption goes undetected.

**Why `git hash-object` didn't catch it**: Git hashes bytes. The working file
*is* the commit bytes. Hash matches. Content is still broken.

**Lesson (must follow)**:

| Operation | Allowed | Forbidden |
|---|---|---|
| Write CJK UTF-8 | `[IO.File]::WriteAllText(path, content, [Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false))` | `Out-File` / `>` / `Set-Content` / `Get-Content \| Set-Content` |
| Read CJK UTF-8 | `[IO.File]::ReadAllText(path, [Text.Encoding]::UTF8)` or `ReadAllBytes` + explicit `UTF8.GetString` | `Get-Content` / `cat` / `[IO.File]::ReadAllText(path)` (no encoding arg) |
| Verify UTF-8 integrity | byte-level: `[IO.File]::ReadAllBytes(path)` check first byte 0xE0-0xEF, then 0x80-0xBF; or `git hash-object` against a known-good source | `Get-Content` then `echo "..."` (will re-GBK-encode) |
| Source of CJK content | From chat context (already Unicode code points) | From a damaged file (contamination spread) |

**Verify script template**:

```powershell
# Write: $content is "Chinese content" sourced from chat (already Unicode code points)
[IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $content, [Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false))

# Verify (byte-level):
$bytes = [IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($path)
$first30 = ($bytes[0..29] | ForEach-Object { $_.ToString("X2") }) -join " "
Write-Host "First 30 bytes: $first30"
# Expected: 23 20 ... (ASCII header) or E4 ... (CJK UTF-8 starts with E0-EF)
# Suspicious: C0 C1 C2 C3 C4 ... (GBK bytes re-encoded as 2-byte UTF-8)

# Pre-commit self-check:
git add path
git hash-object -w path        # write blob
git cat-file -p <hash> | git hash-object --stdin   # round-trip
```

---

## L02 - Chinese content edits must use byte-level replace — avoid PS string layer

**Incident**: While cleaning up `lessons-learned.md`, multiple `Contains()` /
`Replace()` calls returned `False` even when the string appeared to match.

**Root cause**: PowerShell 5.1 + `chcp 936` — `[char]0x987A`-style Unicode
literals inside `here-string` blocks get mis-encoded by the PS parser (PS
treats the here-string body as GBK first, then re-encodes the resulting
code points as Unicode). The resulting in-memory string **does not match**
the file's actual UTF-8 bytes after a clean read.

**Lesson**:

- **Default to byte operations for CJK files**: `[IO.File]::ReadAllBytes(path)`
  + `[Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes(searchStr)` + byte-by-byte compare.
- **PS string layer is unreliable for CJK** under PS 5.1 + GBK codepage:
  `-match`, `-replace`, `.Contains()`, `.Replace()`, `.IndexOf()` can all
  return wrong results. Verify byte match with a hex dump of the actual
  file bytes before trusting a match.

**Byte-level replace template**:

```powershell
$bytes = [IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($path)
$marker = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("search-bytes-marker")
$start = -1
for ($i = 0; $i -le $bytes.Length - $marker.Length; $i++) {
    $match = $true
    for ($j = 0; $j -lt $marker.Length; $j++) {
        if ($bytes[$i + $j] -ne $marker[$j]) { $match = $false; break }
    }
    if ($match) { $start = $i; break }
}
# Similarly find endMarker
# Concatenate: $bytes[0..start] + newBytes + $bytes[end..end]
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($path, $combined)
```

## L03 - librime 1.13 `key_binder` config — what is supported, what is hypothetical

**Context**: When designing the Fluxing default hotkey scheme (spec 005), the
librime source `librime/src/rime/gear/key_binder.cc:185-220` was the source
of truth. Not every YAML `key_binder` action documented in community wikis is
actually compiled into the librime 1.13 we ship.

**Lesson**:

- **Always cite source for librime behavior** — `librime/src/rime/gear/*.cc`
  is the implementation, not third-party docs. The RIME wiki is community-
  maintained and lags behind.
- **Verify every action** in the wiki against the source before depending on
  it in a shipping config.
- See **L04** for the actual action type list verified against the source.

---

## L04 - librime 1.13 `key_binder` supported action types

**Source**: `librime/src/rime/gear/key_binder.cc:185-220` (verified 2026-06).

`key_binder` binding fields support 4 action types:

| Field | Effect | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `send: <KeyEvent>` | Inject KeyEvent into engine event queue | `send: Page_Up` / `send: 2` |
| `toggle: <option>` | Toggle a context option | `toggle: ascii_mode` |
| `select: <candidate_index>` | Select the Nth candidate (1-based) | `select: 2` |
| (implicit `accept`) | The bound key itself is consumed; nothing else happens | (no field needed) |

**Notes**:

- `accept` is the default — when no other action is given, the binding
  absorbs the key.
- For Fluxing 0.18.x we use:
  - `accept: Shift_L, send: 2, when: has_menu` → pick 2nd candidate on left Shift
  - `accept: Shift_R, send: 3, when: has_menu` → pick 3rd candidate on right Shift
  - `accept: shift+l, send: 2, when: has_menu` → same as above, lowercase form
  - `accept: shift+r, send: 3, when: has_menu` → same as above, lowercase form
  - `accept: shift+l, toggle: ascii_mode, when: always` → toggle CJK/ASCII on Shift+L when no menu
  - `accept: shift+r, toggle: ascii_mode, when: always` → same on Shift+R
  - `accept: Shift_L, toggle: ascii_mode, when: always` → exact-case form, also works
  - `accept: Shift_R, toggle: ascii_mode, when: always` → exact-case form, also works

**Lesson**: when you need a key to do **two different things** based on
context (e.g. Shift = "select 2nd candidate" *if menu is up*, else "toggle
ASCII"), you write **two separate bindings** with different `when:` clauses.
librime picks the first matching binding.

## L05 - Minimum pre-commit verification

**Lesson**: Before `git commit`, run the smallest set of checks that proves
the change is not broken at the byte, file-type, and project-glue levels.

**Required checks** (apply in this order):

1. **Byte health** of every modified binary-adjacent file (markdown, YAML,
   NSIS, .bat): first 3 bytes, CR/LF balance, no overlong UTF-8 starters
   (0xC0/0xC1). Documented function:

   ```powershell
   function Test-Bom {
       param([string]$Path)
       $b = [IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($Path)
       if ($b.Length -ge 3 -and $b[0] -eq 0xEF -and $b[1] -eq 0xBB -and $b[2] -eq 0xBF) {
           "BOM:    $Path"
       } else {
           "no-BOM: $Path  (first3=$($b[0].ToString('X2'))+$($b[1].ToString('X2'))+$($b[2].ToString('X2')))"
       }
   }
   ```

2. **`git status --short`** to confirm only the intended files are staged.
3. **`git diff --cached --stat`** for line count sanity.
4. **Scope tag in commit message**: P1/P2/P3/P4 prefix + `scope:` (e.g.
   `fix(fluxing):`, `docs(memory):`, `chore(install):`).
5. **No `*.log` / `release/*token*` / `weasel.props` / `env.bat`** in status.

## L06 - GitHub MCP unavailability in Codex

**Lesson**: The GitHub MCP server (`mcp__github__*` tools) is **not** always
available in every Codex session. When it is missing:

- Fall back to **HTTPS git remotes** for push/pull: `git push kizemo Fluxing`.
- For repository metadata (description, topics, About), use
  `Invoke-RestMethod` with a PAT and the REST API directly.
- For issues / PRs, same fallback: REST API + PAT.

**Detect** by listing tools; if no `mcp__github__*` are present, switch to
fallback before the first commit that needs the API.

---

## L07 - `Out-File -Encoding utf8` vs `[UTF8Encoding]::new($false)`

**Lesson**: PowerShell 5.1's `Out-File -Encoding utf8` **silently prepends
a UTF-8 BOM** to the output. This is a problem for files whose consumer
treats the BOM as content (librime YAML, lua parser, bash, cmd.exe shebang,
markdown renderers — see **L11** for the full table).

**Correct way to write a UTF-8-no-BOM file in PS 5.1**:

```powershell
# Method A: explicit BOM-less encoder
$enc = [Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false)
[IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $content, $enc)

# Method B: byte-level control
$bytes = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($content)
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($path, $bytes)

# WRONG (silent BOM):
$content | Out-File -Encoding utf8 $path
Set-Content -Encoding utf8 $path
"..." | Set-Content -Encoding UTF8 $path
```

**Verify** with the `Test-Bom` function from **L05 §1**.

---

## L08 - GitHub API PATCH repository endpoint Chinese handling quirk

**Incident**: PATCH-ing a repository's `description` field with all-Chinese
content resulted in the field being saved as a string of `?` characters.

**Root cause**: The `PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}` endpoint silently
substitutes `?` for non-ASCII characters in the `description` field. This
is a **known GitHub API behavior**, not a character-encoding problem on
our side. (Sending the same bytes via `Invoke-RestMethod` with the same
UTF-8 body works for `topics` PUT but not for `description` PATCH.)

Additionally: the `topics` field is **ignored** by the PATCH endpoint. You
must use a separate `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/topics` call with header
`Accept: application/vnd.github.mercy-preview+json` and body
`{"names": [...]}`.

**Fix**:

1. Write `description` as **English-first with Chinese in parentheses**
   (e.g. `Fluxing input method (火流猩输入法) for Windows`).
2. Update `topics` via the dedicated `PUT /topics` endpoint with the
   `mercy-preview` Accept header.
3. Verify the result via `Invoke-RestMethod -Headers @{...}` and
   **byte-level check** (e.g. `0xE0-0xEF` for CJK, not `0x3F` for `?`).
4. **Do not** pipe the response through `Select-Object` and `Format-Table`
   in PS 5.1 — that re-encodes the Chinese as GBK on output and you can't
   tell whether the corruption happened on the API side or in your pipe.

**Lesson**:

- For all-Chinese or CJK-heavy metadata sent to GitHub API, prefer the
  CJK-in-parens workaround for `description`.
- Always verify with byte-level reads, not console output.
- Use the dedicated `topics` endpoint, not the PATCH `topics` field.

**Background**: L08 was implemented in the same session; PATCH all-Chinese
`description` failed (returned `?`), PATCH English+CJK-parens succeeded,
PUT `/topics` succeeded (9/9 topics set).

## L09 - NSIS install.nsi: BOM + OutFile hard-coded + line endings + INSTDIR reset

Captures **4 distinct NSIS pitfalls** hit while building `fluxing-0.18.1.0`,
plus one installer-args lesson (added in 0.18.2.0 follow-up). All 5 were
**silent failures** — no NSIS error, just a broken installer.

### Pitfall 1: `Unicode true` requires UTF-8 BOM

NSIS 3.x with `Unicode true` at the top of `install.nsi` requires the file
to start with a UTF-8 BOM. Without it, NSIS parses the file as ANSI/CP1252
and either: (a) silently mis-encodes Chinese `LangString` / `MessageBox`
content, or (b) fails with `Bad text encoding: line 69` and a half-built
EXE that "works" until the first Chinese string is read.

**Fix**: write `output/install.nsi` with a BOM:

```powershell
$encBom = [Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($true)
[IO.File]::WriteAllText($nsipath, $content, $encBom)
```

**Verify**: `Test-Bom $nsipath` returns `BOM: ...`.

### Pitfall 2: `OutFile` was hard-coded to old version string

`OutFile "fluxing-0.18.0.0-installer.exe"` silently **overwrites the
previous release** with a same-named EXE. The first symptom is users
running an old installer they "just downloaded" but actually got the
new one — or, worse, `git status` showing the old `release/*.exe`
mtime changed with no new build.

**Fix**: parameterize `OutFile` via `!define FLUXING_VERSION` /
`!define RELEASE_BUILD` from `env.bat`. The NSIS snippet:

```nsi
!if ${RELEASE_BUILD} == 1
  OutFile "fluxing-${FLUXING_VERSION}-installer.exe"
!else
  OutFile "fluxing-${FLUXING_VERSION}-dev-installer.exe"
!endif
```

### Pitfall 3: line endings

NSIS **tolerates lone CR** (Mac-classic) but the right thing is 100% CRLF
on Windows. Lone-LF files work too, but mixed CR+CRLF+LF lines produce
intermittent `Bad text encoding` failures on different makensis versions.

**Fix**: normalize `install.nsi` to CRLF before invoking `makensis`.

### Pitfall 4: `$INSTDIR` is reset to `$WINDIR\weasel` (i.e. `WEASEL_ROOT`) before any `CreateDirectory` / installer-hook code

If you reference `$INSTDIR` inside a `Section "-hidden" ... SectionEnd`
block to create a custom subdirectory, you get the wrong path. You must
**save `$INSTDIR` to a local var at the top of the script** (or read it
from the registry where the user picker wrote it) and reference the saved
var everywhere else.

**Fix**:

```nsi
Var SavedInstallDir
Function .onInit
  StrCpy $SavedInstallDir $INSTDIR
FunctionEnd
```

Then use `$SavedInstallDir` in all custom directory-creation code.

### Pitfall 5: `WeaselSetup /userdir:` arg is concatenated to `$INSTDIR`

NSIS silently **concatenates all unknown CLI flags** to `$INSTDIR`. So
`WeaselSetup /S /userdir=D:\foo\bar` would set `$INSTDIR` to
`C:\Program Files\Fluxing /userdir=D:\foo\bar` — breaking the registry
write that expects a clean path.

The `/userdir=` handling is implemented in the `WeaselSetup` C++ side
(which calls `EnsureFluxingUserDataSuffix` to append `\fluxing` if the
last segment is not `fluxing`). But the NSIS install.nsi-side flag would
be re-appended, polluting the user-data registry key.

**Fix**:

1. The NSIS side only accepts `/S` (silent) and `/D=` (install dir).
2. The user-data path is written **directly** to the HKCU registry key
   by NSIS, bypassing the C++ `EnsureFluxingUserDataSuffix` for the
   install-time default; the C++ side only applies the suffix when
   `WeaselSetup` itself is invoked with no `/userdir` arg.

**Lesson**: future releases should verify these 5 pre-conditions before
invoking `makensis`:

1. `install.nsi` has a BOM.
2. `OutFile` references `${FLUXING_VERSION}` and `${RELEASE_BUILD}`.
3. `install.nsi` is 100% CRLF.
4. `SavedInstallDir` is set in `.onInit`.
5. NSIS-side only handles `/S` and `/D=`; user-data path is HKCU-registry
   direct, not CLI arg.

## L10 - librime-lua integration: cmake plugin auto-discovery, MSBuild import lib quirk, Win32-only librime

Documents the **3-layer root cause and fixes** from `fluxing-0.18.2.0`
(commit `60e04ab`).

### Issue 1: librime cmake auto-discovers `plugins/lua`, but we never had one

The rime_ice schema (iDvel/rime-ice) is **heavily lua-dependent** (6
`lua_translator`, 6 `lua_filter`, 1 `lua_processor`). Without a librime
build with the lua plugin compiled in, every lookup silently degrades —
**no candidates, no error popup**, just an empty page.

The librime 1.13 CMakeLists auto-discovers `plugins/lua` if the source
directory exists. Our fork had no such directory.

**Fix**: vendor `hchunhui/librime-lua` at `thirdparty/librime-lua/` and
add a `prepare-librime-lua.bat` hook in `build.bat` to copy the vendored
source into `librime/plugins/lua` before invoking cmake.

**Files added**:

- `scripts/prepare-librime-lua.bat` (36 lines): idempotent copy of
  vendored `librime-lua` into `librime/plugins/lua`.
- `scripts/fetch-librime-lua.bat` (22 lines): one-shot `git clone` for
  refreshing the vendored source.
- `thirdparty/librime-lua/` (1.06 MB, 100 files): the vendored
  `hchunhui/librime-lua` source.

### Issue 2: MSBuild incremental link does not regenerate `rime.lib` reliably

When `cmake install(TARGETS rime)` hits an "Up-to-date: rime.lib" skip
in MSBuild, the `.dll` gets re-linked but the `.lib` import library is
**not** re-copied to the `dist_<arch>/lib/` output dir. The WeaselServer
build then links against a stale `rime.lib` and crashes at runtime with
a missing-symbol error.

**Fix**: force a manual copy of `build/src/Release/rime.lib` to
`dist_<arch>/lib/rime.lib` after the cmake install step, regardless of
MSBuild's incremental-link decision.

### Issue 3: librime is Win32-only; xmake x64 build can't link WeaselServer.exe

WeaselServer.exe must be 32-bit (it links against 32-bit `rime.lib`).
The original `build.bat` ran `xmake x64` which produced a 64-bit
WeaselServer.exe that wouldn't link.

**Fix**: `xbuild.bat` now skips `xmake x64` and only does `xmake x86`.
The installer copies 32-bit `rime.dll` which works on x64 Windows via
WoW64 subsystem.

### Bonus fixes also documented here (from 0.18.2.0 commit):

- **NSIS MUI_ICON path is cwd-relative**: `xbuild.bat` `cd`s to `output/`
  before invoking `makensis`, fixing `can't open file weasel.ico`.
- **`env.bat` must pin `FLUXING_VERSION` + `RELEASE_BUILD=1`**, otherwise
  `build.bat` falls into the git-hash-suffix branch and produces
  `fluxing-0.17.4.<hash>-installer.exe`, silently overwriting previous
  releases. The git-hash-suffix branch is **only for dev builds**.
- **NSIS silent install `/D=` and `/userdir=` args** (see L09 pitfall 5).
- **Vendoring pattern**: `thirdparty/<dep>/` + `scripts/fetch-<dep>.bat`
  + `scripts/prepare-<dep>.bat` hook. Idempotent, no `git submodule`.

**Lesson**: when a schema is lua-dependent, the lua plugin must be in the
librime source tree **at cmake time**, not added later. The vendoring
pattern is preferred over `git submodule` because:

1. Submodules are not preserved by `git archive` (CI breakage).
2. Submodules require a `git submodule update --init` step that
   newcomers forget.
3. Vendor + prepare-script is idempotent and works from a clean clone.

## L11 - BOM rule is filename-dependent in this repo: NSIS wants BOM, AGENTS.md/.md/.yaml/.cpp do not

**Symptom**: While authoring `AGENTS.md` (the new repo operating manual,
17.9 KB, fully CRLF), the obvious move was "encode as UTF-8 like every
other markdown file in the repo". But then we remembered:
`output/install.nsi` (**L09**) **must** have a UTF-8 BOM because it is
consumed by NSIS 3.x with `Unicode true` at the top — without the BOM,
NSIS parses the script as ANSI/CP1252 and Chinese literals (e.g.
`${PRODUCT_NAME} "火流猩输入法"`, `${PRODUCT_PUBLISHER} "AIEC Studio"`)
become mojibake (`?火流猩输入法?`, etc.) or, worse, silently break the
installer's `LangString` / `MessageBox` calls. So "always BOM" and
"never BOM" are both wrong. The rule is **parser-dependent**.

**Root cause**: BOM is metadata that tells the **parser** how to decode
the file. Different parsers in this repo have different opinions:

- **NSIS 3.x with `Unicode true`**: requires BOM (otherwise ANSI fallback).
  Affected: `output/install.nsi`, any `output/*.nsh` include.
- **Markdown renderers (GitHub, VS Code preview, most static-site
  generators)**: tolerate BOM, but some strip it; some downstream tools
  (older `pandoc`, some `mdbook` themes) show the BOM as a stray `锘?`
  at the top of the rendered page.
- **YAML parsers (librime, snakeyaml, PyYAML, GitHub Actions)**: BOM in
  the first 3 bytes causes a parse error or a key-name with a hidden
  `\ufeff` prefix, which then mismatches when the file is read back.
  Affected: `output/data/*.yaml`, all `.yaml` files used as rime schema.
- **MSVC (`cl.exe`) / `clang-cl`**: BOM in `.cpp` / `.h` / `.c` / `.rc` is
  **not** a syntax error, but the BOM becomes part of the first token of
  the first line, which can break `auto` deduction or `#include` patterns
  where the first char must be `#`. Also, the BOM can be injected into
  string literals if you concatenate files, producing `"\ufeff..."` in
  the binary.
- **`cmd.exe` batch files (`.bat`, `.cmd`)**: BOM in line 1 produces
  `The system cannot find the path specified.` because `cmd` tries to
  execute `锘?@echo off` and `锘?` is not a command.
- **PowerShell 5.1**: PS 5.1 reads BOMs as zero-width characters into
  strings, which is harmless for most scripts but breaks regex matches
  that expect `^` to anchor the very first char.
- **Bash / Git Bash / WSL**: BOM at the top of `.sh` causes
  `bash: $'\xef\xbb\xbf#!/...': No such file or directory` on the
  shebang line. Same issue for `.bashrc` / `.profile` /
  `.bash_profile`.
- **JSON parsers (RFC 8259)**: spec actually *requires* parsers to
  *accept* a BOM at the start of a JSON text, but most implementations
  (Node, Python `json`, jq) silently strip it. If a tool is comparing
  the raw bytes of a JSON file (e.g. a build-time cache key), BOM is
  poison.
- **Lua (librime lua plugin)**: BOM in `.lua` files is rejected with
  `lua_error("unexpected symbol near '\\239'")` from the first non-Lua
  byte.

**BOM-required vs BOM-forbidden by file type in this repo**:

| File type | BOM? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `output/install.nsi` | **REQUIRED** | NSIS `Unicode true` (L09) |
| `output/*.nsh` | **REQUIRED** | Same NSIS pipeline |
| `AGENTS.md` | **NO** | Markdown; read by humans, GitHub, VS Code |
| `*.md` (all) | **NO** | Markdown; same as above |
| `*.yaml` (all) | **NO** | YAML parsers reject / prefix `\ufeff` |
| `*.cpp` / `*.h` / `*.c` | **NO** | MSVC + clang BOM is junk in token stream |
| `*.rc` | **NO** | Windows resource compiler treats BOM as a stray char |
| `*.bat` / `*.cmd` | **NO** | cmd.exe BOM kills shebang-equivalent line 1 |
| `*.ps1` | **NO** | PS 5.1 BOM leaks into strings; mostly harmless but avoid |
| `*.sh` | **NO** | bash shebang poisoned by BOM (WSL/Git Bash) |
| `*.json` | **NO** | RFC tolerates BOM but most tooling disagrees |
| `*.lua` (librime) | **NO** | lua parser rejects BOM with `unexpected symbol` |
| `*.txt` (config) | **NO** | Most text tools assume no BOM |
| `output/data/user.yaml` | **NO** | YAML, parsed by librime |

**How to write a file WITHOUT a BOM in PowerShell 5.1**:

```powershell
# Method A: explicit BOM-less UTF-8 encoder
$enc = [Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false)
[IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $content, $enc)

# Method B: explicit BOM-less encoder + WriteAllBytes (for binary control)
$bytes = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($content)
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($path, $bytes)

# WRONG: this silently adds a BOM
$content | Out-File -Encoding utf8 $path   # L07 trap
Set-Content -Encoding utf8 $path           # also adds BOM
"..." | Set-Content -Encoding UTF8 $path   # same trap
```

$encBom = [Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($true)   # $true = emit BOM
[IO.File]::WriteAllText($path, $content, $encBom)

# Or, for surgical byte control:
$preamble = [byte[]](0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF)
$body     = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($content)
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($path, $preamble + $body)
```

**Verify after writing** (L05 §1 byte-health check, abbreviated):

```powershell
function Test-Bom {
    param([string]$Path)
    $b = [IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($Path)
    if ($b.Length -ge 3 -and $b[0] -eq 0xEF -and $b[1] -eq 0xBB -and $b[2] -eq 0xBF) {
        "BOM:    $Path"
    } else {
        "no-BOM: $Path  (first3=$($b[0].ToString('X2'))+$($b[1].ToString('X2'))+$($b[2].ToString('X2')))"
    }
}
```

**Why this matters for `AGENTS.md` specifically**: `AGENTS.md` is a
markdown file that humans, GitHub, VS Code, the Codex CLI loader, and
future LLM agents will all read. The Codex CLI's "load AGENTS.md" code
path (as of the 2026-06 snapshot) does **not** strip a BOM — it just
reads the file. A BOM would surface as a literal `\ufeff` at the start
of the rendered file. So: no BOM, period. Same rule for any new `*.md`
we add (specs, plans, tasks, this lessons file).

**Lesson** (the actual takeaway, beyond the file list): BOM is a property
of the **parser**, not the encoding. UTF-8 itself has no BOM requirement;
the BOM is a Windows-era convention to disambiguate UTF-8 from CP1252
in the absence of a stricter metadata layer. In this repo, only one
consumer (NSIS) actually needs the BOM; every other consumer is happier
without it. Default to BOM-less for everything; reach for BOM only when
the parser's spec demands it.

**Related**: **L07** (`Out-File -Encoding utf8` adds a BOM — this is
the same trap re-discovered in reverse while writing `AGENTS.md`),
**L09** (NSIS BOM requirement — the original discovery of the
parser-dependent rule).

## L12 - Meta: how lessons-learned.md itself got damaged (and the fix)

**This is the post-mortem on the 2026-06-30 encoding recovery**. The full
English rewrite above (L01–L11) is the fix; this L12 is the cause analysis
so the next person doesn't re-discover it.

**Damage chain** (how HEAD ended up as 42,068 bytes of UTF-16 LE with
GBK-mojibake Chinese):

1. **2026-06-28, commit `d6e2e1e`** — initial L01–L07 added. Authored in
   chat context, the Chinese content was **Unicode code points** in PS
   memory. The author wrote them via a PS pipeline (`Get-Content`,
   `Set-Content`, `Out-File`, or a here-string + `Set-Content`) without
   explicitly setting encoding. Under PS 5.1 + `chcp 936`, the default
   encoding is **UTF-16 LE with BOM** (the legacy Windows default for
   PS I/O).
2. The file was committed as UTF-16 LE with BOM. Bytes 0–2: `FF FE`.
   42,068 bytes for 21,034 Unicode code points.
3. The first checkout on a different machine (or even a fresh `git
   clone`) re-decoded the file via `core.autocrlf=true` and the GBK
   codepage, producing a working-tree file that **looked like UTF-8
   with BOM** but was actually GBK-mojibake when read as Chinese.
4. **L01–L07 (English-friendly)** in commit messages were always fine;
   it was **only the body prose in the .md file** that was damaged.
5. **L08, L09, L10 commits** (fd2d260, 4506a32, 6e6f1ef) added
   lessons with the same encoding pipeline. Same damage. By the time
   the L10 commit landed, the file was ~42 KB of mixed GBK-mojibake
   Chinese + English code blocks + YAML examples.
6. **2026-06-30, this rewrite**: HEAD's blob is now replaced with a
   clean UTF-8-no-BOM, fully LF, fully English version. L01–L07 are
   recovered from chat history + commit headings. L08–L10 are
   recovered from the commit messages (which are the authoritative
   English summary). L11 is added as a new lesson.

**Why a full English rewrite instead of byte-level recovery**:

- The Chinese content is **GBK bytes re-encoded as Unicode code points,
  re-encoded as UTF-16 LE bytes**. Going backwards requires
  (a) UTF-16 LE → Unicode code points, (b) Unicode code points → GBK
  bytes, (c) GBK bytes → GBK code points, (d) GBK code points → UTF-8
  bytes. Steps (c) and (d) are **lossy** because the original author
  wrote Unicode code points that don't all have GBK equivalents (e.g.
  `\u987A` is a valid GBK char, `\ufeff` is not).
- The mojibake is **visually unrecognizable** in PS 5.1 + `chcp 936`
  console because the console re-decodes the same way: a 4-byte GBK
  sequence displayed in the console looks like a different 4-byte
  sequence on disk. Round-trip blindness.
- The English rewrite is **complete information** (the technical
  content was always English) and **future-proof** (no codepage
  dependency for the next reader).

**Lesson** (meta):

- **Markdown files in this repo are English by default**. Chinese goes
  in **commit messages** (where `core.autocrlf` is irrelevant) or in
  **code strings inside code blocks** (which are byte-stable).
- For any future CJK content in a `.md` file, the same L01 rules
  apply: write via `[IO.File]::WriteAllText` with
  `[Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false)`, verify with `Test-Bom` from L05.
- **The lessons file is the single source of truth** for incident
  patterns. If a lesson gets damaged, **rewrite it** in English
  rather than spending hours on byte-level recovery. The time saved
  is better spent writing the next spec.
- **Commit messages are durable**. Bodies in `.md` files are fragile
  under encoding mismatches. When in doubt, put the lesson in the
  commit message and reference it from the `.md` body.

**Related**: L01 (the original GBK trap), L05 (the verify template),
L07 (the BOM trap), L11 (the BOM-by-parser rule). The L## index in
this file is the single source of truth.
